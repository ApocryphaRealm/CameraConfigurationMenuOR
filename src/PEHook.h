// ProcessEvent observers by class, through a vtable ENTRY swap (slot 0x4D) - no code is patched, so this coexists
// with UE4SS's ProcessEvent hook on the shared body in either load order (logic library 7555, 2026-09-29).
//
// Several classes may share one native vtable; each vtable is swapped once, the original pointer is remembered per
// vtable, and the one detour calls every handler registered for the object's class before the original. Handlers
// run on the game thread, before the function body.
